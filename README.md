## General Information
Every loan application to a lending organisation brings in two types of risk-
   1. Not approving a loan to a good customer is loss to business
   2. Approving loan to a customer who might default loan payment is a financial loss.
   
Analysing past consumer behaviours might help the lending organisation to filter out customer who is probable to default a loan. Prime objective of this project is to understand borrower traits and identify the driving variable that would determine if a customer is supposed to default the loan payment.
